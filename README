Here's a handful of tools for dealing with logs with ANSI color.

Some tools like gcc, dmesg, grep --color, colordiff, ccze, etc can enhance
their output with color, making reading a lot more pleasant.  The difference
can be as big as between slogging through twenty pages of a build log to
find a failure, and a swift drag of the scroller to do the same within a
second.

Such colored logs can be usually viewed on a terminal or with "less -R";
this package gives you:
 * ansi2html: convert logs to HTML
 * ansi2txt: drop ANSI control codes
 * ttyrec2ansi: drop timing data from ttyrec files
 * pipetty: makes a program think its stdout and stderr are connected to a
   terminal; use as a prefix: "pipetty dmesg|tee"
