.SH NAME
ansi2html \- ansi to HTML converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ansi2html
.RB [ -n ]
.RB [ -w ]
.BI < log
.BI > outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ansi2html
will convert the ANSI log into a pretty HTML page, converting ANSI color
codes into HTML tags.  All standard colors and attributes are supported;
this does not include xterm-only extensions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -n
Don't produce a HTML header.  This allows including the log into a web page
you make some other way.  You are responsible for setting background color
appropriately -- to black or something dark in the default on-black mode,
or to white/light when \fB-w\fR is used.  Fancy-schmancy background images
are fine.
.TP
.B -w
Make the background white.  This is contrary to most terminals but matches
most webpages.  Text requested to be bolded (normally bright white) will be
turned bold black, but explicit bright white
.I will not
be changed, becoming invisible (just like explicit black is invisible in the
normal on-black mode).
.SH CAVEATS
ANSI codes other than color codes are ignored; possibly causing misformatted
output.
